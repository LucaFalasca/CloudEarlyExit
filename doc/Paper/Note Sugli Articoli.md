## Introduzione

> [!Quote|] Abstract [[CoEdge.pdf#page=1&selection=34,0,47,8|CoEdge, p.1]]
> > Abstract— Recent advances in artificial intelligence have driven increasing intelligent applications at the network edge, such as smart home, smart factory, and smart city. To deploy computationally intensive Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) on resourceconstrained edge devices, traditional approaches have relied on either offloading workload to the remote cloud or optimizing computation at the end device locally. However, the cloud-assisted approaches suffer from the unreliable and delay-significant widearea network, and the local computing approaches are limited by the constrained computing capability. Towards high-performance edge intelligence, the cooperative execution mechanism offers a new paradigm, which has attracted growing research interest recently

## Design and Workflow

### Design
> [!PDF|important] [[CoEdge.pdf#page=4&selection=74,33,83,1&color=important|CoEdge, p.4]]
> > For the device that launches a CNN inference task, we label it as the master device, and for the device that joins the cooperation, it is marked as the worker device.

Nella fase di setup l'intero modello viene fatto eseguire ai vari dispositivi partecipanti al sistema per trovare le varie capacità di esecuzione dei dispositivi! La cosa credo dipenda dal tipo di modello: 
- se il modello è medio piccolo può anche andare, ma se non lo è non so quanto possa funzionare la cosa; 
- dipende molto anche dalla dimensione del modello: se il modello è troppo grande per entrare in memoria potrebbe non essere proprio possibile l'esecuzione (per quanto in realtà potrebbe entrare in gioco lo swap a quel punto). 
Si tratterebbe comunque di un costo pagato una sola volta in fase di registrazione del server nel sistema: questo potrebbe permettere anche aiutare per la parte di profilazione della quantizzazione.

### Workflow
> [!PDF|important] [[CoEdge.pdf#page=4&selection=205,15,212,48&color=important|CoEdge, p.4]]
> > We exploit model parallelism to partition CNN inference over multiple devices. Under model parallelism, CNN model parameters are divided into subsets and assigned to multiple edge nodes. With respective parameters, each device accepts a necessary part of the input feature maps and generates a portion of the output feature maps. 

> [!PDF|important] [[CoEdge.pdf#page=4&selection=217,39,219,21&color=important|CoEdge, p.4]]
> > To accommodate devices’ heterogeneity, the partition sizes are differentiated to match device capabilities.

## Partitioning
> [!PDF|note] [[CoEdge.pdf#page=6&selection=51,1,63,53&color=note|CoEdge, p.6]]
> > We assume that the devices are available and relatively stable during the inference runtime. This can be relevant as executing an inference task is typically in a period of seconds, and many edge environments are maintained statically in independent spaces, such as smart home and smart factory. Besides, the underlying support of intelligent services in such scenarios usually employs a few commonly-adopted DNN models and frequently run similar types of DNN inference tasks. Therefore, we suppose that the DNN models have been loaded ahead of inference queries, and can be used to compute input tensors as soon as necessary data are prepared.

> >  A resource tuple (ρ, f, m, P c, P x)i specifics the resource profile of device i. Here, ρ is defined as the computing intensity (in processing cycles per 1KB input) of the given DNN model, which is measured by applicationdriven offline profiling [[Energy_Efficiency_mobile_clients_cloud_computing.pdf|26]] in the setup phase. f is the device’s CPU frequency, reflecting its computing capability in a coarse granularity. m is the available maximum memory capacity for inference tasks. For a single device that only processes CNN workloads, m is the volume of memory excluding the space taken by the underlying system services, e.g., I/O services, compiler, etc. P c and P x denote the computation power and the wireless transmission power, respectively.

> > During a single layer’s execution, the system takes time and energy on two aspects, computation and communication. For computation, we calculate the latency and energy by first approximating the computing cycles of given partitions. As demonstrated in previous empirical studies [26], [28], [29], for many data processing tasks as exemplified by data encoding and decoding, the required computing cycles are proportional to their input data sizes. This means that, a constant computing intensity (in computing cycles per unit data) exists for such tasks, and we can use it to capture the effective computing capability of a specific device. Existing literature, such as [30]–[32], has leveraged this observation to characterize deep learning workloads, and in this work, we adopt it to estimate the computing cycles amount given the partitions and DNN layers

Questo è un altro aspetto importante: in questo caso si sta tenendo in considerazione il fatto che i vari dispositivi stanno lavorando in parallelo, perché l'input viene diviso in modo tale che tutto il modello sia calcolato su questo input. **Noi il parallelismo non lo stiamo considerando nella risoluzione del problema.**

In CMOS circuits [3], the energy per operation Eop is proportional to V 2, where V is the supply voltage to the chip. Moreover, it has been observed that the clock frequency of the chip, f , is approximately linearly proportional to the voltage supply of V [3]. Therefore, the energy per operation can be expressed as Eop = κf 2, where κ is the energy coefficient depending on the chip architecture. The optimization problem can then be formulated as

> Modern real-time applications widely embed compute intense neural algorithms at their core. Current solutions to support such algorithms either deploy highly-optimized Deep Neural Networks at mobile devices or offload the execution of possibly larger higher-performance neural models to edge servers. While the former solution typically maps to higher energy consumption and lower performance, the latter necessitates the low-latency wireless transfer of high volumes of data. Timevarying variables describing the state of these systems, such as connection quality and system load, determine the optimality of the different computing configurations in terms of energy consumption, task performance, and latency.

Indeed, the most advanced SC frameworks, where specialized models embed neural encoder/decoder-like structures, result in minimal computing load to the mobile device, while considerably reducing network usage [1].

## Aspetti preliminari

> [!PDF|note] Edge Computing [[Furcifer_PerCom24.pdf#page=3&selection=101,0,111,27&color=note|Furcifer_PerCom24, p.3]]
> Edge Computing: The execution of the task on the edge server allows the use of high-performance models (e.g., large non-quantized models). However, the limited computing capabilities of ESs compared to cloud servers means that the server may struggle to serve a large number of task streams. Moreover, the need to transfer the input data to ES means that robust and high-capacity wireless channels are needed.

> [!PDF|note] Local Computing [[Furcifer_PerCom24.pdf#page=3&selection=123,0,162,42&color=note|Furcifer_PerCom24, p.3]]
> Local Computing: In settings where the task complexity is low enough to match the capabilities of the mobile device, then local execution of the algorithm is a viable option. A trade-off is struck between task performance, power consumption and frame rate. Importantly, LC performance is not dependent on the state of the wireless channel connecting the M D to the ES, or the network and server load. In this context, quantization assumes a pivotal role in reducing execution time and energy consumption and enabling the use of better performing models whose use would otherwise be impractical on resource-constrained devices with limited computational capabilities. However, LC implies high energy usage, which leads to a reduced battery lifespan.

> [!PDF|note] Split Computing [[Furcifer_PerCom24.pdf#page=3&selection=166,0,200,1&color=note|Furcifer_PerCom24, p.3]]
> Split (collaborative) Computing - SC: In SC, a subset of operations that would be executed on the ES is allocated to the mobile device. This subset often includes pre-processing operations, such as JPEG encoding and partial model inference altered to embed neural supervised encoding [33]. The objective is to decrease the amount of data to be transported over the wireless channel while minimizing the involvement of M D and possibly also decreasing the server load. This computing modality proves advantageous in settings where the communication channel’s reliability is compromised, bandwidth demands exceed channel capacity or computing demands exceed server capacity. SC is specifically designed to address this scenario by mitigating both channel usage and computation burden on the ES.

### SC Engine

In sostanza l'approccio qui è il seguente (da quello che sto capendo):
- Caso LC: computazione fatta solo su dispositivo locale e ok
- Caso EC: vengono usati dei meccanismi di compressione (eg JPEG) per ridurre la quantità di dati da trasferire da una parte all'altra
- Caso SC: vengono usati dei modelli di encoding nel device e di decoding nel edge node per poi eseguire il modello sull'edge node

Non abbiamo quindi un effettivo split del modello, ma un qualche tipo di codifica per ridurre i dati da trasferire. [[Furcifer_PerCom24.pdf#page=2&selection=262,0,276,11&color=note|Furcifer_PerCom24, p.2]].

In questo caso infatti stiamo considerando questi aspetti:
- Tempo di inferenza (e fin qui ok)
- Accuratezza
	- L'accuratezza dipende dal metodo di compressione. Come viene indicato anche nell'articolo, i formati tipo JPEG anche se forniscono un buon mezzo di compressione non sono ottimizzati per l'inferenza: un approccio basato su knowledge distillation quindi può risultare migliore in questo contesto

> he optimized encoder heavily relies on quantization and channel compression to reduce execution time as much as possible. To enhance data compression, we strategically place a one-channel bottleneck in the initial layers of the feature extraction segment of the network. This choice leads to further data reduction, increasing the efficiency of the whole process. Additionally, we incorporate INT8 quantization at the end of the encoder. This quantization approach optimizes the representation of the data, contributing to both improved data compression and streamlined computation. The dynamic nature of the system is upheld by calculating the scaling factor and zero point on a per-image basis as they are processed. These values are then communicated to the decoder located at the ES, along with the resulting INT8 tensor from the encoder inference process.

> The increased use of deep neural networks has stimulated the growing demand for cloud-based model serving platforms. Serverless computing offers a simplified solution: users deploy models as serverless functions and let the platform handle provisioning and scaling. However, serverless functions have constrained resources in CPU and memory, making them inefficient or infeasible to serve large neural networks—which have become increasingly popular.

> Unlike VMs, serverless functions have constrained resources in CPU and memory [10]–[12]. As very large DNNs are increasingly used for improved accuracy [13]–[15], using serverless functions to serve those models is inefficient or simply becomes infeasible with out-of-memory (OOM) errors

> n this paper, we propose Gillis1, a serverless-based model serving system that automatically explores parallel executions of DNN inference across multiple functions for faster inference and reduced per-function memory footprint. Our design follows the fork-join computing model: upon receiving an inference request, a master function is invoked to initiate multiple worker functions, each hosting a partition of the model. The master interacts with workers through stateless connections (function invocations). To reduce communications between master and workers, Gillis performs coarse-grained model partitioning. It fuses multiple consecutive layers of a DNN model into a single layer group. The model can have multiple layer groups. Gillis partitions each layer group for parallel execution. Such coarse-grained partitioning allows a function to compute all layers in a group locally, hence avoiding frequent synchronizations with the other functions.

## Background and Motivation

### Serverless Based
> [!PDF|note] [[gillis-icdcs21.pdf#page=2&selection=87,0,93,19&color=note|gillis-icdcs21, p.2]]
> Compared with VMs, serverless functions have a far shorter startup latency (e.g., 10s ms if warm-started) and can quickly scale out to a large number of instances to accommodate the surging inference requests in a short period of time. On the other hand, serverless functions are not well suited to serve stable workloads, as they have a high price per request [3], [23]. 

### Large Models

> Model Compression reduces the network parameters of a large DNN and creates a significantly smaller network that can run on a resource-constrained device (e.g., mobile and edge devices). Popular model compression techniques include network pruning [16] and weight quantization [17]. However, this approach usually results in reduced accuracy and requires careful model tuning or even retraining to minimize the accuracy loss, which is too laboring for developers [13].

> 
> Model Partitioning Another promising approach is to divide a large neural network into multiple small partitions and run them in parallel [13], [18]–[21], [34], [35]. Compared with compression, model partitioning sacrifices no accuracy while accelerating the computation and reducing the perpartition resource footprint. We therefore choose it over model compression in our design.

> A master function is triggered to run upon receiving an inference query. Following the computed partitioning scheme, the master asynchronously invokes multiple worker functions. Each worker computes a partition of the served model, returns the result to the master, and ends its execution. The master can also help to compute a partition if having sufficient memory, which can result in fewer workers and less cost. The master assembles the returned results from all workers into a full tensor, and may initiate more workers to continue parallelizing model execution.

### Coarse Grained Parallilization

> First, our layer grouping is not limited to convolution layers, but applies to all. This enables more parallelization opportunities, yet significantly increases the search space for optimal grouping as a DNN model can have a large number of layers. To address this problem, we propose to merge consecutive element-wise layers (e.g., ReLU) and branch modules, if any.

> While layer grouping reduces the communication overhead, grouping too many layers can be inefficient, especially for those with convolution-like operators. As these operators (e.g., convolution and pooling) map multiple input elements to a single output, parallelizing the output tensor results in an overlap in the input partitions (Fig. 2a). As more layers are grouped, more overlaps are added, causing more redundant computations in the intermediate layers. Also, as the layer group grows larger, its partition may not fit into the memory of a single function. Parallelizing a layer group across too many functions can also be inefficient, as it may incur significant synchronization overhead in function communications, undermining the benefits of parallelization.

The partitioner takes as input the DNN layers and determines how these layers are fused into groups and how each group is parallelized. Given the layer groups, the placer determines how partitions are placed on the master and workers, which works out a detailed function execution plan.

> Recent advancements in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have catalyzed the development of numerous intelligent mobile applications and services. However, they also introduce significant computational challenges for resource-constrained mobile devices. To address this, collaborative edge inference has been proposed. This method involves partitioning a DNN inference task into several subtasks and distributing these across multiple network nodes. Despite its potential, most current approaches presume known network parameters—like node processing speeds and link transmission rates—or rely on a fixed sequence of nodes for processing the DNN subtasks. In this paper, we tackle a more complex scenario where network parameters are unknown and must be learned, and multiple network paths are available for distributing inference tasks.

> Growing number of contemporary applications and services, such as augmented reality/virtual reality, face recognition, and speech assistant, demand real-time inferencing of deep neural networks (DNNs), which can effectively extract high-level features from the raw data at high computational complexity cost [1], [2]. In many cases of practical importance, these applications often are run at resource-constrained embedded devices, such as mobile phones, wearables and IoT devices in next-generation networks [3], [4]. However, it is very challenging to compute the DNN inference tasks at resource-constrained devices due to the limited computation and battery capacity. Therefore, it is crucial to leverage external computation resources to realize the full potential and benefits of future devicebased artificial intelligence (AI) applications

> On the other hand, these devices can also provide alternative paths between the mobile device and the edge server, particularly useful when the direct communication link experiences poor conditions.

Key challenges:
1. compared to partitioning the DNN between just two devices, the decision space expands significantly. This expansion involves not only selecting an appropriate communication path between the mobile device and the edge server but also assigning DNN layers to the devices along the path to distribute the DNN inference workload effectively
2. he end-to-end inference latency is contingent on the computing speed of the devices and the transmission speed of the links along the selected path. These speeds fluctuate over time and may not be known beforehand when making collaborative inference decisions
3. switching devices for collaborative edge inference necessitates reloading and setting up the DNN models in the device memory, which introduces overhead and can impact the overall inference latency. Thus, frequent device and path switching is undesirable.

> In this paper, we study the joint optimization of path selection and DNN layer assignment in collaborative edge inference across multiple devices. Specifically, we explore scenarios where multiple paths exist between a source node (i.e., the mobile device) and a destination node (i.e., the edge server), with a focus on optimizing path selection and DNN layer assignments to minimize end-to-end inference delay.


## System Model

Questo aspetto è abbastanza simile alla nostra formulazione: ho un tot di richieste che vengono formulate e ognuna ha la sua DNN associata.

>  In addition to the edge server, there are other available devices in the network, functioning as relays and creating multiple possible communication paths between the mobile device and the edge server. The mobile device needs to sequentially process a series of DNN inference tasks, denoted by the task index t = 1, . . . , T . Each task t is a DNN inference task using DNNt, which might change over time or remain constant. Each inference task utilizes input data collected by the mobile device and aims to deliver the inference results to the edge server for downstream applications/services.

La rete di nodi sottostanti è considerata un DAG, quindi non è considerata la possibilità di tornare indietro: l'output evidentemente viene mantenuto a livello dell'edge server finale. Nel nostro caso invece considerare un grafo generico permette di considerare anche percorsi alternativi: ad esempio una situazione in cui in fase di elaborazione ci si allontana via via dal device e mano mano che ci si avvicina all'output ci si riavvicina al device.

> Our first result highlights the splitting positions within a DNN that would never emerge in the optimal layer assignment based solely on information about the DNN architecture. This means that even without knowledge of node processing speeds and link transmission speeds, and without solving the optimal layer assignment problem, it is possible to pre-group DNN layers into blocks. Consequently, rather than conducting DNN layer assignment directly, we can alternatively pursue DNN block assignment.

Questa assunzione di base è un'assunzione forte: non c'è nessuna garanzia che questo avvenga in un modello generico. Si tratta comunque di un teorema che potrebbe essere usato per descrivere il fatto che lo spazio di ricerca seppur grande presenta un numero alto di combinazioni che non portano a niente. Una possibile alternativa potrebbe essere usare un approccio simile a questo e far eseguire l'ottimizzazione sui blocchi, prendendo come flops la somma dei layer nel blocco.

> Proposition 1. Assume that among all layer outputs and the input, the data size of the output layer is the smallest, i.e., sL < sl, ∀l ∈ {0, ..., L − 1}. In the optimal layer assignment, the data sizes at the intermediate output splitting points form a non-increasing sequence.

In generale comunque anche qui non viene fatta una gestione effettiva dei branch e dei rami paralleli del modello: ci si limita a considerare il tutto come un blocco e dividere i blocchi. C'è da dire che nella parte sperimentale è sottolineato come sono considerati ResNet50 e YoLo (credo versione 1 - confermato dal paper a cui si rimanda il link) che sono dei modelli tendenzialmente lineari: non è quindi necessario gestire la complessità di rami paralleli.

![[Splitting_2.pdf#page=5&rect=52,480,290,618&color=note|Splitting_2, p.5]]

Anche questo dipende dalla situazione. Nel contesto del paper può avere senso: si sta assumendo un DAG, quindi l'output non può mai tornare al generatore, ma nel nostro caso è esattamente il contrario.

> n recent years, deep learning models have become ubiquitous in industry and academia alike. Deep neural networks can solve some of the most complex pattern-recognition problems today, but come with the price of massive compute and memory requirements. This makes the problem of deploying such large-scale neural networks challenging in resource-constrained mobile edge computing platforms, specifically in mission-critical domains like surveillance and healthcare. To solve this, a promising solution is to split resource-hungry neural networks into lightweight disjoint smaller components for pipelined distributed processing. At present, there are two main approaches to do this: semantic and layer-wise splitting. The former partitions a neural network into parallel disjoint models that produce a part of the result, whereas the latter partitions into sequential models that produce intermediate results. However, there is no intelligent algorithm that decides which splitting strategy to use and places such modular splits to edge nodes for optimal performance.

Given the prevalence and demand of DNN inference, serving them on a public cloud with tight bounds of latency, throughput and cost is becoming increasingly challenging [9]. In this regard, recent paradigms like mobile edge computing seem promising. Such approaches allow a robust and low-latency deployment of Internet of Things (IoT) applications close to the edge of the network.

> SplitPlace is the first splitting policy that dynamically decides between semantic and layer-wise splits to optimize both inference accuracy and the SLA violation rate. This decision is taken for each incoming task and remains unmodified until the execution of all split fragments of that task are complete. The idea behind the proposed splitting policy is to decide for each incoming task whether to use the semantic or layer-wise splitting strategy based on its SLA demands.

## Background

> Semantic splitting divides the network weights into a hierarchy of multiple groups that use a different set of features (different colored models in Fig. 1). Here, the neural network is split based on the data semantics, producing a tree structured model that has no connection among branches of the tree, allowing parallelization of input analysis [16]. Due to limited information sharing among the neural network fragments, the semantic splitting scheme gives lower accuracy in general. Semantic splitting requires a separate training procedure where publicly available pre-trained models cannot be used. This is because a pre-trained standard neural network can be split layer wise without affecting output semantics. For semantic splitting we would need to first split the neural network based on data semantics and re-train the model. However, semantic splitting provides parallel task processing and hence lower inference times, more suitable for mission-critical tasks like healthcare and surveillance.

> Layer-wise splitting divides the network into groups of layers for sequential processing of the task input, shown as different colored models in Fig. 1. Layer splitting is easier to deploy as pre-trained models can be just divided into multiple layer groups and distributed to different mobile edge nodes. However, layer splits require a semi-processed input to be forwarded to the subsequent edge node with the final processed output to be sent to the user, thus increasing the overall execution time. Moreover, layer-wise splitting gives higher accuracy compared to semantic splitting.

> Some worker nodes are assumed to be mobile, whereas others are considered to be fixed in terms of their geographical location. In our formulation, we consider mobility only in terms of the variations in terms of the network channels and do not consider the worker nodes or users crossing different networks

> The main idea behind the layer-wise split design is first to divide neural networks into multiple independent splits, classify these splits in preliminary, intermediate and final neural network layers and distribute them across different nodes based on the node capabilities and network hierarchy. This exploits the fact that communication across edge nodes in the LAN with few hop distances is very fast and has low latency and jitter [51]. Moreover, techniques like knowledge distillation can be further utilized to enhance the accuracy of the results obtained by passing the input through these different classifiers. However, knowledge distillation needs to be applied at the training stage, before generating the neural network splits. As there are many inputs in our assumed large-scale deployment, the execution can be performed in a pipelined fashion to further improve throughput over and above the low response time of the nodes at the edge of the network

> [!PDF|note] [[Tuli_Splitting.pdf#page=6&selection=29,9,52,26&color=note|Tuli_Splitting, p.6]]
> For the semantic split, we divide the network weights into a set or a hierarchy of multiple groups that use disjoint sets of features. This is done by making assignment decisions of network parameters to edge devices at deployment time. This produces a tree-structured network that involves no connection between branched sub-trees of semantically disparate class groups. Each sub-group is then allocated to an edge node. The input is either broadcasted from the broker or forwarded in a ring-topology to all nodes with the network split corresponding to the input task. We use standard layer [32] and semantic splitting [16] methods as discussed in Section 2.

> This sharing of containers for each splitting strategy and dataset type are transferred to the worker nodes is performed at the start of the run. At run-time, only the decision of which split fragment to be used is communicated to the worker nodes, which executes a container from the corresponding image. The placement of task on each worker is based on the resource availability, computation required to be performed in each section and the capabilities of the nodes (obtained by the Resource Monitor

## Introduzione

> As DL-based classifiers improve their predictive accuracy, mobile applications such as speech recognition in smartphones [20, 45], real-time unmanned navigation [105], and drone-based surveillance [129, 170] are increasingly using DNNs to perform complex inference tasks. However, state-of-the-art DNN models present computational requirements that cannot be satisfied by the majority of the mobile devices available today.

> [!PDF|note] [[Survey_Splitting.pdf#page=2&selection=31,49,34,22&color=note|Survey_Splitting, p.2]]
> Notably, the execution of such complex models significantly increases energy consumption. While lightweight models specifically designed for mobile devices exist [122, 138], the reduced computational burden usually comes to the detriment of the model accuracy.

> [!PDF|note] [[Survey_Splitting.pdf#page=2&selection=45,6,46,96&color=note|Survey_Splitting, p.2]]
> On the other hand, due to excessive end-to-end latency, cloud-based approaches are hardly applicable in most of the latency-constrained applications where mobile devices usually operate.

> edge computing (EC) approaches [10, 88] have attempted to address the “latency vs. computation” conundrum by completely offloading the DNN execution to servers located very close to the mobile device, i.e., at the “edge” of the network. However, canonical EC does not consider that the quality of wireless links—although providing high throughput on average—can suddenly fluctuate due to the presence of erratic noise and interference patterns, which may impair performance in latency-bound applications

> As a consequence, if part of the workload is allocated to the mobile device, then the execution time increases, while the battery lifetime decreases. However, as explained later, the workload executed by the mobile device may result in a reduced amount of data to be transferred over the wireless channel, possibly compensating for the larger execution time and leading to smaller end-to-end delays.

> In local computing (LC), the function M (x) is entirely executed by the mobile device. This approach eliminates the need to transfer data over the wireless channel. However, the complexity of the best-performing DNNs most likely exceeds the computing capacity and energy consumption available at the mobile device

> In EC, the input x is transferred to the edge server, which then executes the original model M (x). In this approach, which preserves full accuracy, the mobile device is not allocated computing workload, but the full input x needs to be transferred to the edge server. This may lead to an excessive end-to-end delay in degraded channel conditions and erasure of the task in extreme conditions.

> The distance d (x, ˆx) defines the performance of the encoding-decoding process ˆx = G (F (x)), a metric that is separate from, but may influence, the accuracy loss of M ( ˆx) with respect to M (x), that is, of the model executed with the reconstructed input with respect to the model executed with the original input. Clearly, the encoding/decoding functions increase the computing load at both the mobile device and edge server side. A broad range of different compression approaches exists ranging from low-complexity traditional compression (e.g., JPEG compression for images in EC [101]) to neural compression models [4, 5, 162]

### Split Computing and Early Exiting

> More recent SC frameworks introduce the notion of bottleneck to achieve in-model compression toward the global task [90]. As formally described in the next section, a bottleneck is a compression point at one layer in the model, which can be realized by reducing the number of nodes of the target layer and/or by quantizing its output. We note that as SC realizes a task-oriented compression, it guarantees a higher degree of privacy compared to EC. In fact, the representation may lack information needed to fully reconstruct the original input data.

### Lightweight models

> [!PDF|note] [[Survey_Splitting.pdf#page=6&selection=17,0,20,7&color=note|Survey_Splitting, p.6]]
> From a conceptual perspective, the design of small deep learning models is one of the simplest ways to reduce inference cost. However, there is a tradeoff between model complexity and model accuracy, which makes this approach practically challenging when aiming at high model performance. 

> [!PDF|note] [[Survey_Splitting.pdf#page=6&selection=20,7,21,22&color=note|Survey_Splitting, p.6]]
> The MobileNet series [47, 48, 122] is one among the most popular lightweight models for computer vision tasks,

> The largest variant of MobileNetV3, MobileNetV3-Large 1.0, achieves a comparable accuracy to ResNet-34 [43] for the ImageNet dataset, while reducing by about 75% the model parameters.

### Model Compression

> [!PDF|note] [[Survey_Splitting.pdf#page=6&selection=59,0,61,86&color=note|Survey_Splitting, p.6]]
> A different approach to produce small DNN models is to “compress” a large model. Model pruning and quantization [38, 39, 55, 79] are the dominant model compression approaches. The former removes parameters from the model, while the latter uses fewer bits to represent them.

> [!PDF|note] [[Survey_Splitting.pdf#page=6&selection=70,0,71,93&color=note|Survey_Splitting, p.6]]
> Knowledge distillation [8, 46] is another popular model compression method. While model pruning and quantization make trained models smaller, the concept of knowledge distillation is to provide outputs extracted from the trained model (called “teacher”) as informative signals to train smaller models (called “student”) in order to improve the accuracy of predesigned small models. Thus, the goal of the process is that of distilling knowledge of a trained teacher model into a smaller student model for boosting accuracy of the smaller model without increasing model complexity.

>  Concerning metrics, many of the studies in Table 1 do not discuss task-specific performance metrics such as accuracy. This is in part because the proposed approaches do not modify the input or intermediate representations in the models (i.e., the final prediction will not change). On the other hand, Choi and Bajić [13], Cohen et al. [16], and Li et al. [73] introduce lossy compression techniques to intermediate stages in DNN models, which may affect the final prediction results. Thus, discussing the tradeoff between compression rate and task-specific performance metrics would be essential for such studies.

> many of the models considered in such studies have weak performance compared with state-of-the-art models and complexity within reach of modern mobile devices. Specific to image classification tasks, most of the models considered in the studies listed in Table 1 are more complex and/or the accuracy is comparable to or lower than that of lightweight baseline models such as MobileNetV2 [122] and MnasNet [138]. Thus, in future work, more accurate models should be considered to discuss the performance tradeoff and further motivate SC approaches.


### Bottleneck Injection

> There are a few trends observed from their experimental results: (1) communication delay to transfer data from the mobile device to edge server is a key component in SC to reduce total inference time; (2) all the neural models they considered for NLP tasks are relatively small (consisting of only a few layers), which potentially resulted in finding that the output layer is the best partition point (i.e., local computing) according to their proposed approach; and (3) similarly, not only DNN models they considered (except VGG [128]) but also the size of the input data to the models (see Table 2) are relatively small, which gives more advantage to EC (fully offloading computation).

> Some models, such as AlexNet [64], VGG [128], and DenseNet [51], possess such layers [90]. However, recent DNN models such as ResNet [43], Inception-v3 [136], Faster R-CNN [117], and Mask R-CNN [42] do not have natural bottlenecks in the early layers; that is, splitting the model would result in compression only when assigning a large portion of the workload to the mobile device

> For these reasons, introducing artificial bottlenecks to DNN models by modifying their architecture is a recent trend and has been attracting attention from the research community. Since the main role of such encoders in SC is to compress intermediate features rather than to complete inference, the encoders usually consist of only a few layers.

> n worlds, the two first sections of the modified model transform the input x into a version of the output of the th layer via the intermediate representation z, thus functioning as encoder/decoder functions. The model is split after the first section; that is, ME is the head model, and the concatenation of MD and MT is the tail model. Then, the tensor z is transmitted over the channel. The objective of the architecture is to minimize the size of z to reduce the communication time while also minimizing the complexity of ME (that is, the part of the model executed at the—weaker—mobile device) and the discrepancy between y and ˆy. The layer between ME and MD is the injected bottleneck

If the output still does not reach the target confidence, the intermediate layer’s output is forwarded to the cloud, which executes the largest neural model

## Challenges

### Bottleneck Design
> [!PDF|note] [[Survey_Splitting.pdf#page=21&selection=70,22,73,69&color=note|Survey_Splitting, p.21]]
> As suggested in [96], important metrics include (1) bottleneck data size (or compression rate), (2) complexity of the head model executed on the mobile device, and (3) resulting model accuracy. As a principle, the smaller the bottleneck representation is, the lower the communication cost between the mobile device and edge server will be.

> [!PDF|note] [[Survey_Splitting.pdf#page=21&selection=81,33,89,50&color=note|Survey_Splitting, p.21]]
>  since mobile devices often have limited computing resources and may have other constraints such as energy consumption due to their battery capacities, SC should aim at minimizing their computational load by making head models as lightweight as possible. For instance, designing a small bottleneck at a very early stage of the DNN model enables a reduction in the computational complexity of the head model 

> [!PDF|note] [[Survey_Splitting.pdf#page=22&selection=11,0,14,31&color=note|Survey_Splitting, p.22]]
> In general, it is challenging to optimize bottleneck design and placement with respect to all three different metrics, and existing studies empirically design the bottlenecks and determine the placements. Thus, theoretical discussion on bottleneck design and placement should be an interesting research topic for future work.


### Expanding Domains
> [!PDF|note] [[Survey_Splitting.pdf#page=22&selection=33,0,48,14&color=note|Survey_Splitting, p.22]]
> The application domains of SC and (in minor part) EE remain primarily focused on image classification. This focus may be explained by the size of the input, which makes compression a relevant problem in many settings and the complexity of the models and tasks. However, there are many other unexplored domains from which SC would benefit.


### Information-Theoretic Perspective

> A possible approach to justify SC and EE can be found in the study of information bottlenecks (IBs), which were introduced in [142] as a compression technique in which a random variable X is compressed while preserving relevant information about another random variable Y. The IB method has been applied in [143] to quantify mutual information between the network layers and derive an information theory limit on DNN efficiency

> Neurosurgeon runtime system and layer performance prediction models – We develop a set of models to predict the latency and power consumption of a DNN layer based on its type and configuration, and create Neurosurgeon, a system to intelligently partition DNN computation between the mobile and cloud. 

## Status Quot

> loud processing has a significant computational advantage over mobile processing, but it does not always translate to end-to-end latency/energy advantage due to the dominating data transfer overhead

## Neurosurgeon
> [!PDF|note] [[Neurosurgeon.pdf#page=7&selection=376,0,381,17&color=note|Neurosurgeon, p.7]]
> The best partition point for a DNN architecture depends on the DNN’s topology, which manifests itself in the computation and data size variations of each layer. In addition, dynamic factors such as state of the wireless network and datacenter load affect the best partition point even for the same DNN architecture.

> [!PDF|note] [[Neurosurgeon.pdf#page=7&selection=408,0,412,37&color=note|Neurosurgeon, p.7]]
> Neurosurgeon profiles the mobile device and the server to generate performance prediction models for the spectrum of DNN layer types.  per-application profiling is not needed. This set of prediction models are stored on the mobile device and later used to predict the latency and energy cost of each layer 

### Performance Prediction Model
> [!PDF|note] [[Neurosurgeon.pdf#page=8&selection=207,0,217,18&color=note|Neurosurgeon, p.8]]
> Neurosurgeon models the per-layer latency and the energy consumption of arbitrary neural network architecture. This approach allows Neurosurgeon to estimate the latency and energy consumption of a DNN’s constituent layers without executing the DNN.

> [!PDF|note] [[Neurosurgeon.pdf#page=8&selection=218,0,225,10&color=note|Neurosurgeon, p.8]]
> We observe that for each layer type, there is a large latency variation across layer configurations. Thus, to construct the prediction model for each layer type, we vary the configurable parameters of the layer and measure the latency and power consumption for each configuration. Using these profiles, we establish a regression model for each layer type to predict the latency and power of the layer based on its con- figuration.

> [!PDF|note] [[Neurosurgeon.pdf#page=8&selection=228,0,232,33&color=note|Neurosurgeon, p.8]]
> Based on the layer type, we use either a logarithmic or linear function as the regression function. The logarithmic-based regression is used to model the performance plateau as the computation requirement of the layer approaches the limit of the available hardware resources.

> [!PDF|note] [[Neurosurgeon.pdf#page=8&selection=238,31,254,53&color=note|Neurosurgeon, p.8]]
> The regression model for convolution layer is based on two variables: the number of features in the input feature maps, and (f ilter size/stride)2 × (# of f ilters), which represents the amount of computation applied to each pixel in the input feature maps.

> he candidate points are after each layer. Lines 16 and 18 evaluate the performance when partitioning at each candidate point and select the point for either best end-to-end latency or best mobile energy consumption. Because of the simplicity of the regression models, this evaluation is lightweight and efficient

> In the time of inference, the first part of the network is quantized and executed on the edge devices, and the second part of the network is executed in the cloud servers. On the edge, we use quantized neural network to reduce storage and computation. In the cloud, we use original full-precision network to achieve high accuracy.

> [!PDF|note] [[Deep_Feature_Compression.pdf#page=4&selection=15,0,20,29&color=note|Deep_Feature_Compression, p.4]]
> As seen in the figure, when the split point is close to the input (e.g. max 3, conv 6 or conv 10 layers), the data volume is too large, and even with lossless compression of feature data, it is more efficient to simply upload input images to the cloud. But as we move down the network, it becomes more advantageous to upload feature data.

Il problema rispetto al mio caso è che questo approccio è usato solo come mezzo di compressione dei dati, non tenendo in conto il beneficio che ne deriva in termini di calcolo.
> [!PDF|note] [[Deep_Feature_Compression.pdf#page=4&selection=2,0,8,7&color=note|Deep_Feature_Compression, p.4]]
> We first test the impact of lossless compression (after the Q-layer) on accuracy. As is common with multi-class object detectors [18], we use mean Average Precision (mAP) as a measure of accuracy, and look at its variation with 8-bit, 10bit and 12-bit quantization in the Q-layer. The compression of feature data is quantified using average Kbits per image (KBPI).

> Despite the recent improvements of the mobile devices mentioned earlier, the computational power of mobile devices is still significantly weaker than the cloud ones. Therefore, the mobile-only approach can cause large inference latency and failure in meeting QoS. Moreover, embedded devices undergo major energy consumption constraints due to battery limits. On the other hand, cloud-only suffers communication overhead for uploading the raw data and downloading the outputs. Moreover, slowdowns caused by service congestion, subscription costs, and network dependency should be considered as downsides of this approach [11].

> However, there is a trend of applications requiring adaptive learning in online environments, such as self-driving cars and security drones [12] [13]. Model parameters in these smart devices are constantly being changed based on their continuous interaction with their environment. 

> [!PDF|note] [[JointDNN.pdf#page=2&selection=2,0,7,47&color=note|JointDNN, p.2]]
> The main difference of collaborative training and cloudonly training is that the data transferred in the cloud-only approach is the input data and model parameters but in the collaborative approach, it is layer(s)’s output and a portion of model parameters. Therefore, the amount of data communicated can be potentially decreased [14].

> In this work, we are investigating the inference and training of DNNs in a joint platform of mobile and cloud as an alternative to the current single-platform methods

> [!PDF|note] [[JointDNN.pdf#page=2&selection=49,25,59,56&color=note|JointDNN, p.2]]
> Considering DNN architectures as an ordered sequence of layers, and the possibility of computation of every layer either on mobile or cloud, we can model the DNN structure as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). The parameters of our real-time adaptive model are dependent on the following factors: mobile/cloud hardware and software resources, battery capacity, network specifications, and QoS. Based on this modeling, we show that the problem of finding the optimal computation schedule for different scenarios, i.e. best performance or energy consumption, can be reduced to the polynomial-time shortest path problem.

> his sequence suggests the computation of the first few layers on the mobile device to avoid excessive communication cost of uploading large raw input data. On the other hand, the growth of the layer output size from input to output in generative models which are used for synthesizing new data, implies the possibility of uploading a small input vector to the cloud and later downloading one of the last layers and performing the rest of computations on the mobile device for better efficiency.

> [!PDF|important] [[JointDNN.pdf#page=2&selection=100,0,106,9&color=important|JointDNN, p.2]]
> As we will see in Section 4, the communication between the mobile and cloud is the main bottleneck for both performance and energy in the collaborative approach. We investigated the specific characteristics of CNN layer outputs and introduced a loss-less compression approach to reduce the communication costs while preserving the model accuracy.

## Problem

> [!PDF|note] [[JointDNN.pdf#page=3&selection=30,0,39,10&color=note|JointDNN, p.3]]
> Statistical Modeling: In this method, a regression model over the configurable parameters of operators (e.g. filter size in the convolution) can be used to estimate the associated latency and energy. This method is prone to large errors because of the inter-layer optimizations performed by DNN software packages. Therefore, it is necessary to consider the execution of several consecutive operators grouped during profiling. 

> [!PDF|yellow] [[JointDNN.pdf#page=3&selection=42,0,54,56&color=yellow|JointDNN, p.3]]
> In order to illustrate this issue, we designed two experiments with 25 consecutive convolutions on NVIDIA PascalTM GPU using cuDNN R© library [18]. In the first experiment, we measure the latency of each convolution operator separately and set the total latency as the sum of them.

> [!PDF|note] [[JointDNN.pdf#page=3&selection=89,0,96,11&color=note|JointDNN, p.3]]
> Application-specific Profiling: In this method, the DNN architecture of the application being used is profiled in run-time. The number of applications in a mobile device using neural networks is generally limited. In conclusion, this method is more feasible, promising higher accuracy estimations

> [!PDF|note] [[JointDNN.pdf#page=3&selection=70,0,77,27&color=note|JointDNN, p.3]]
> Analytical Modeling: To derive analytical formulations for estimating the latency and energy consumption, it is required to obtain the exact hardware and software speci- fications. However, the state-of-the-art in latency modeling of DNNs [19] fails to estimate layer-level delay within an acceptable error bound,

> However, the problem of the shortest path subjected to constraints is NP-Complete [22]. For instance, assuming our standard graph is constructed for energy and we need to find the shortest path subject to the constraint of the total latency of that path is less than a time deadline (QoS). However, there is an approximation solution to this problem, ”LARAC” algorithm [23], the nature of our application does not require to solve this optimization problem frequently, therefore, we aim to obtain the optimal solution.
